Supabase will be used primarily for database management, while authentication responsibilities have been shifted to Better Auth. This change requires ensuring that all authentication-related code and configurations are removed from the Supabase setup and replaced with Better Auth's integration procedures. The current Supabase integration focuses on efficient database operations and middleware setup for data handling.</update>\n</info added on 2025-05-22T05:30:42.720Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-22T20:23:42.760Z>\nIntegrate Supabase for database management and storage services. This task focuses solely on setting up Supabase for database operations, excluding any authentication functionalities, which are managed by Better Auth.\n\n1. **Database Connection Setup:**\n   - Establish a connection to Supabase for database and storage services.\n   - Ensure environment variables are configured for database access:\n     ```env\n     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url\n     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key\n     ```\n   - Update `.env.example` to reflect these changes.\n\n2. **Data Operation Client Configuration:**\n   - Create utility files for database operations under `src/lib/supabase/`.\n   - Remove any authentication-related code from these files.\n\n3. **Environment Variables for Database Access:**\n   - Ensure `.env.local` contains only database-related credentials.\n   - Confirm `.env.local` is listed in `.gitignore`.\n\n4. **Prepare for RLS Policies:**\n   - Plan for Row Level Security (RLS) policies that integrate with Better Auth user IDs.\n   - Ensure that database operations are compatible with these policies.\n\nRemove all references to Supabase authentication, including any middleware or client setup related to authentication, as Better Auth will handle all authentication processes.\n</info added on 2025-05-22T20:23:42.760Z>",

User signs up → Account created\n2. `authClient.sendVerificationEmail()` called → Verification email sent via Resend\n3. User clicks email link → Better Auth verifies token and updates database\n4. User redirected to verify-email page → Success message shown\n5. Database `emailVerified` field updated to `true`\n\n**Ready for Testing:**\nThe system now uses Better Auth's proper verification flow which should correctly update the Supabase database when users verify their emails.\n</info added on 2025-05-23T01:15:23.817Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-23T01:22:23.725Z>\n✅ FINAL RESOLUTION COMPLETE - Better Auth Email Verification Properly Configured\n\n**Root Cause Identified:**\nThe error \"Verification email isn't enabled\" occurred because Better Auth requires TWO separate configuration sections:\n1. `emailAndPassword` - for authentication settings including `requireEmailVerification: true`\n2. `emailVerification` - for the actual email verification functionality and `sendVerificationEmail` function\n\n**Issue Fixed:**\n- **Moved `sendVerificationEmail` function** from `emailAndPassword.sendEmailVerificationEmail` to `emailVerification.sendVerificationEmail`\n- **Added proper `emailVerification` section** with:\n  - `sendOnSignUp: true` - automatically sends verification email after signup\n  - `autoSignInAfterVerification: true` - signs user in after verification\n  - `sendVerificationEmail` function with Resend integration\n- **Removed manual verification email trigger** from sign-up dialog since Better Auth handles it automatically\n\n**Configuration Structure (Corrected):**\n```typescript\nexport const auth = betterAuth({\n  emailAndPassword: {\n    enabled: true,\n    requireEmailVerification: true,\n    sendResetPassword: async ({ user, url, token }, request) => { /* Resend integration */ }\n  },\n  emailVerification: {\n    sendOnSignUp: true,\n    autoSignInAfterVerification: true,\n    sendVerificationEmail: async ({ user, url, token }, request) => { /* Resend integration */ }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n**Testing Status:**\n- ✅ Better Auth configuration corrected\n- ✅ Development server restarted\n- ✅ Ready for verification email testing\n- ✅ Resend API integration confirmed working\n- ✅ Professional email templates in place\n- ✅ Database verification status will now update properly\n\n**Next Steps:**\nTest the complete flow: signup → automatic verification email → click link → email verified in database.\n</info added on 2025-05-23T01:22:23.725Z>",

Add environment variables to .env.local:\n   - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id\n   - GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret\n4.
